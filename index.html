    <h1>Hi! I'm Kai Chen! [THIS WEBSITE IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION]</h1>
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p1>
      Hello! My name is <strong>Kai Chen</strong>.
    </p1>

    <p2>
      I am currently a third year at UC Berkeley double majoring in Economics and Data Science.
      I am an out of state student from Connecticut! On campus, I am a part of a business organization called
      Phi Beta Lambda as a Senior Analyst. I am also active as a community member in an organization called REACH! which is the
      Asian Pacific Islander Recuirtment and Retention Center where I helped out as a family head or a volunteer during the many
      high school mentorship conferences that they host at UC Berkeley. I have an interest in both tech and business as well as
      helping other!

      I immigranted to the US when I was 3 years old with my older brother and mother as my father moved to the US earlier to set up a life for us.
      I am a first generation college student. I am able to speak a dialect of Cantonese called Taishanese. My family decided to settle in a
      small town in Connecticut where I attended Norwich Free Academy for high school. There I was captain of the girls tennis team and participated
      in many different clubs in order to try new things and learn more about my culture.
