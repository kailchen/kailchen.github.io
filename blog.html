    This is my first blog post. Welcome to my website. I want to try something new so that is the reason for the website.
    I've always wanted to do something like so maybe when I have time, I will make this website more pretty and interactive.
    This is still a rough draft of it. I've always wanted to build a personal brand and I think this is one of the first steps to it!

    Basically today was a super long day. I was in San Francisco for my business club's final deliverable! I got off the Bart at 12:45pm and
    then I had to hurry back to my class in Cory Hall :/. Then in my class, it was time for our final presentation so I've been presenting nonstop all day!
    All I want to do right now is go home and SLEEP HAHA!
